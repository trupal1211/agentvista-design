          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground !mt-6">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
          <p>Personal Information is any information that can be used to individually identify you from a larger group, such as data including, but not limited to, your:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>first and last name,</li>

            <li>comments or messages provided in free text boxes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you provide us Personal Information, we may combine that Personal Information from other data we have collected about you to learn more about you and to provide additional services.</p>
          <p>You may provide us Personal Information when you:</p>

            <li>register yourself with our Website.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The information that you provide in each case will vary. In some cases, we may ask you to create a username and password that should only be known to you.</p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground !mt-6">Automated Information Collection</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the information that you provide to us, we may also collect information about you during your visit to our Website. We collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below. These tools may collect information about your behavior and your computer system, such as your internet address (IP Address), the pages you have viewed, and the actions you have taken while using our Website.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground !mt-4">(a) Cookies</h4>
          <p>
            A "cookie" is a small data file transmitted from a website to your computer's hard drive. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Instead, we use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
          </p>
          <p>Cookies are usually defined in one of two ways, and we may use both of them:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>session cookies, which do not stay on your computer after you close your browser, and</li>
            <li>persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until you delete them or they expire.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We may use the following categories of cookies on our Website:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies.</strong> These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Cookies.</strong> These cookies collect anonymous information on how people use our Website to help us understand how you arrive at our site, browse or use our Website and highlight areas where we can improve.</li>
            <li><strong>Functionality Cookies.</strong> These cookies remember choices you make such as the country from which you visit our Website, your preferred language, and your search parameters.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeting Cookies or Advertising Cookies.</strong> These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Of course, if you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser's settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Website's features or lose access to some functionality.</p>

          <h4 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground !mt-4">(b) Embedded Web Links</h4>
          <p>
            Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking system allows us to understand how the link is being used by email recipients. Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground !mt-4">(c) Third-Party Websites and Services</h4>
          <p>
            We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground !mt-8">Do Not Track Disclosure</h2>
          <p>
            We may use cookies or other technologies to enable us to serve AgentVista advertisements to you on trusted third party websites. However, no Personal Information is shared in such advertisement placements. Our Website recognizes and responds to Do Not Track ("DNT") signals from your internet web browser. If you choose to enable such DNT features, you will not receive such advertisements on third party websites.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground !mt-8">Your Choices and Selecting Your Privacy Preferences</h2>
          <p>
            We want to provide you with relevant information that you have requested. When you initially make contact with us, such as through requesting a white paper or requesting a demonstration of a product, we will add your information to our communications list. If we provide subscription-based services, such as email newsletters, we will always allow you to make choices about what information you provide at the point of information collection or at any time after you have received a communication from us while you are subscribed to the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may opt-out of receiving communications from us at any time by selecting the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each email. Please note that by opting out or unsubscribing you might affect other services you have requested we provide to you, in which email communication is a requirement of the service provided.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground !mt-8">Accuracy and Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to maintain and process your information accurately. We have processes in place to maintain all of our information in accordance with relevant data governance frameworks and legal requirements. We employ technologies designed to help us maintain information accuracy on input and processing.

          <p>
            We do not actively seek to gather information from individuals under the age of eighteen (18). We do not target our Website to minors, and would not expect them to be engaging with our websites or services. We encourage parents and guardians to provide adequate protection measures to prevent minors from providing information unwillingly on the internet. If we are aware of any Personal Information that we have collected about minors, we will take steps to securely remove it from our systems.
